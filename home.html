              heritage of each district.It is achive by using method "Supply Chain".</p><br>

            <h2>What is Blockchain ?</h2>
        </center>
        <p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial
             role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited
              to cryptocurrency uses. Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe the inability
               to be altered.</p><br>
        <p>Because there is no way to change a block, the only trust needed is at the point where a user or program enters data. This aspect
             reduces the need for trusted third parties, which are usually auditors or other humans that add costs and make mistakes.</p>
